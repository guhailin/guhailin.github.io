# Unit38 If I do ... and If I did ...


When we imagine something that will not happen, or we don't expect that it will happen, we use **if** + past. But the meaning is not past:

>What would you do **if** you **won** a lot of money?(we don't really expect this to happen)  
>**If** there **was(or were)** an election tomorrow,who would you vote for?

---
We do not normally use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence:
> I'd be very scared **if** somebody **pointed** a gun at me. (not if somebody would point)  
> **If** we **went** by bus, it would be cheaper.(not If we would go)

But you can use **If ... would** when you ask somebody to do something:
> I would be grateful **if** you **would let** me know your decision as soon as possible.

---
In the other part of the sentence(not the **if**-part) we use **would/wouldn't**:

> What **would** you **do** **if** you were bitten by a snake?  
> I'm not going to bed yet. I'm not tired. If I went to bed now, I **wouldn't sleep**.  
> **Would** you **mind** if I used your phone?

**Could** and **might** are also possible
