# Unit21 Will/shall 1

We use **I'll**(= **I will**) when we've just decided to do something. When we say '**I'll** do something', we announce our decision:

> Oh, I've left the door open, **I'll go** and shut it.  
> 'What would you like to drink?' '**I'll have** an orange juice, please.'  
> 'Did you phone Lucy?' 'Oh,no,I forgot. **I'll phone** her now.'

We often use **I think I'll ...** and **I don't think I'll ...**

In spoken English the negative of **will** is usually **won't(= will not)**.

Do not use **will** to talk about what you decided before(see Units 19-20):

> I'**m going** on holiday next Saturday.(not I'll go)  
> **Are** you **working** tomorrow?(not Will you work).  

We often use **will** in these situations:

*Offering to do something*
> That bag looks heavy. **I'll help** you with it.(not I help)  

*Agreeing to do something*
> A:Can you give Tim this book?  
> B:Sure, **I'll give** it to him when I see him this afternoon.

*Promising to do something*
> Thanks for lending me the money. **I'll pay** you back Friday.  
> **I won't tell** anyone what happened. I promise.

*Asking somebody to do something(**Will you...?)
>**Will you** please turn the music down? I'm trying to concentrate.

You can use **won't** to say that somebody refuses to do something:
> I've tried to give her advice, but she **won't listen**.
> The car **won't start** (=the car 'refuses' to start)

**Shall** is used mostly in the questions **Shall I ... ?**/**Shall we ... ?**

We use **shall I ...?/shall we ...?** to ask somebody's opinion:
> **Shall I** open the window?
> '**Shall we** go?' 'Just a minute. I'm not ready yet.'
