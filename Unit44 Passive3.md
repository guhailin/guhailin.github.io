# Unit44 Passive 3

**I was offered .../we were given ...**etc.

Some verbs can have two objects. For example, **give**:
> Somebody gave **the police**(object 1) **the information**(object 2).

So it is possible to make two passive sentences:
> **The police** were given the information.  
> **The information** was given to the police.

Other verbs which can have two objects are:
> ask  
> offer  
> pay  
> show  
> teach  
> tell

> **I've been offered** the job, but I don't think I'll accept it.  
> I didn't see the original document but **I was shown** a copy.

**I don't like being**

The passive of **doing/seeing** etc. is **being done/being seen** etc. Compare:

*active*  
> I don't like **people telling me** what to do.  

*passive*  
> I don't like **being told** what to do.

**I was born...**

> I **was born** in Chicago.  
> Where **were** you **born**?  
> How many babies **are born** every day.

**Get**  

You can use **get** instead of **be** in the passive:
> There was a fight at the party, but nobody **got hurt**. (=nobody **was** hurt)  
> I don't **get invited** to many parties. (=I'**m** not invited)

We use **get** only when things happen. For example, you cannot use **get** in these sentences:
> Jessica **is liked** by everybody. (not gets liked - this is not a 'happening')  
> Peter was a mystery man. Very little **was known** about him. (not got known)

We use **get** mainly in informal spoken English. You can use **be** in all situations.

We also use **get** in the following expressions(which are not passive in meaning):
> **get married, get divorced**  
> **get dressed** (=put on your clothes)  
> **get lost**(= not know where you are)  
> **get changed**(= change your clothes)
