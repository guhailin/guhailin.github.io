# Unit42 Passive 1(is done/was done)

When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does:
> My grandfather was a builder. **He built** this house in 1961.  
> It's a big company. **It employs** two hundred people.

When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject:
> 'How old is this house?' '**It was built' in 1961.

---
When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:
> **Is** this room **cleaned** every day?

If we want who does or what causes the action, we use **by**:
> This house was built **by my grandfather**.

---
The passive is **be(is/was** etc.) + past participle (**done/cleaned/seen**):
> (be)done  
> (be)cleaned  
> (be)damaged  
> (be)built  
> (be)seen  

For irregular past participles (**done/seen/known** etc.),see Appendix 1.
