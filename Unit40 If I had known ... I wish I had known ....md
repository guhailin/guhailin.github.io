# Unit40 If I had known... I wish I had known ...

We use **if + had** ... to talk about the past:
> I didn't see you when you passed me in the street. **If I'd seen** you, of course I would have said hello. (but I didn't see you)  
> I didn't go out last night. I would have gone out **if I hadn't been** so tried.

Compare:
> I'm not hungry. **If I was** hungry, I would eat something. (now)  
> I wasn't hungry. **If I had been** hungry, I would have eaten something.(past)

---
Do not use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence. We use **would** in the other part of the sentence:
> **If I had seen** you, I **would have said** hello.

---
We use had(done) in the same way after **wish**. I **wish** something **had happened** = I am sorry that it didn't happen:
> I **wish I'd known** that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him.
---
Compare **would** and **would have**:
> If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would be** tired now. (I am not tired now - present)  
> If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would have met** lost of people.(I didn't meet lots of people - past)
