# Unit46 Have something done

we use **have something done** to say that we arrange for somebody else to do something for us.

Compare:
> Lisa **repaired** the roof. (= she repaired it herself)  
> Lisa **had** the roof **repaired**. (=she arranged for somebody else to repair it)

> 'Did you **make** those curtains yourself?' 'Yes, I enjoy making things'  
> 'Did you **have** those curtains **made**?' 'No,I made them myself.'

---
Be careful with word order. The *past participle* is after the *object*:

||||
|--|--|---|
|**have**|*object*|*past participle*|
|Lisa **had**|the roof|**repaired** yesterday.|
|Where did you **have**|your hair|**cur**?|
|your hair looks nice. Have you **had**|it|**cut**?|

**Get something done**

You can also say '**get** something done' instead of '**have** something done':
> When are you going to **get the roof instead**? (= have the roof repaired)

Somethings **have something done** has a different meaning. For example:
> Paul and Karen **had their bags stolen** while they were travelling.

This does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their bags. 'They **had their bags stolen**' means only: 'Their bags were stolen'.

With this meaning, we use **have something done** to say that something happens to somebody or their belongings. Ofter what happens is not nice:
> Gary **had** his nose **broken** in a fight. (= his nose was broken)  
> Have you ever **had** your bike **stolen**?
