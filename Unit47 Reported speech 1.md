# Unit47 Reported speech 1 (He said that ...)

You want to tell somebody what Paul said.

There are two ways of doing this:
> Paul said '**I'm feeling ill**.'  
> Paul said **that he was feeling ill**.

---
When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past. The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
> Paul **said** that he **was feeling** ill.  
> I **told** Lisa that I **didn't have** any money.

You can leave out **that.** So you can say:
> Paul **said** he was feeling ill.

---
The *past simple* can usually stay the same in reported speech, or you can change it to the *past perfect*:
> Paul said he **woke** up feeling ill, so he **didn't go** to the work.   
> Paul said he **had woken** up feeling ill, so he **hadn't gone** to work.
