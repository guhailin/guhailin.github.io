# Unit48 Reported speech 2

It is not always necessary to change the verb in reported speech. If the situation is still the same,you do not need to change the verb the past. For example:
> Paul said 'My new job **is** boring.'  
> Paul said that his new job **is** boring.(The situation is still the same. His job **is** still boring now.)

You can also change the verb to the past.

But if the situation has changed or finished, you must use a past verb.

You need to use a post form when there is a difference between what was said and what is really true.

**Say** and **tell**

If you say who somebody is talking to, use **tell**:
> Sonia **told me** that you were in hospital. (no Sonia said me)

Otherwise use **say**:
> Sonia **said** that you were in hospital. (not Sonia told that)

But you can '**say** something **to** somebody':
> Ann **said** goodbye **to** me and left. (not Ann said me goodbye)

**Tell/ask** somebody **to** do something

We also use the infinitive (**to do**/**to be** etc) in reported speech, especially with **tell** and **ask**:
> The doctor **told me to drink** plenty of water.  
> Jackie **asked me to help** her.

You can also say 'Somebody **said (not) to** do something'
