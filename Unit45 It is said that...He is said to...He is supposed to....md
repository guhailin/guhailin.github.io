**(Be)supposed to**  

Sometimes **(it is)supposed to ...** = (it is) said to ...:
> Iwant to see that file. It**'s supposed to be good.

But sometimes **supposed to** has a different meaning. We use **supposed to** to say what is intended, arranged or expected. Often this is different from the real situation:
> The plan **is supposed to be** a secret, but everybody seems to know about it.(=the plan is intended to be a secret)  
> What are you doing at work? You**'re supposed to be** on holiday.

You're **not supposed to** do something = it is not allowed or advisable:
> You**'re not supposed to park** your car here. It's private parking only.
