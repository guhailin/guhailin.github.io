# Unit39 If I knew... I wish I knew...

When we imagine a situation, we use **if** + past.But the meaning is present, not past:
> There are many things I'd like to do **if** I **had** more time.
> **If** you **were** in my position, what would you do?

---
We use the past in the same way after **wish**. We use **wish** to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like to be:
> I **wish** I **knew** Paul's phone number.(=I don't know it and I regret this)  
> Do you ever **wish** you **could** fly?  
> it rains a lot here. I **wish** it **didn't** rain so much.
> I **wish** I **didn't** have to work tomorrow, but unfortunately I do.

---
After **if** and **wish**, you can use **were** instead of **was**.
**If I was/I wish it was** are also possible. So you can say:
> **If I were** you, I wouldn't by that coat.(*or* **If I was** you...)

---
We do not normally use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence or after **wish**:
> I **wish** I **had** something to read.(not I wish I would have)
---
**Could** sometimes means 'would be able to' and sometimes 'was/were able to':
> I wish I **could** help you.(I wish I could = I wish I was able)
