# Unit 41 Wish

You can say '**I wish you luck/all the best/a happy birthday**'.
We say 'wish somebody something'.But you cannot say 'I wish that something happens'. We use **hope** in this situation. For example:
> I'm sorry you're not well. I **hope** you **feel** better soon.(not I wish you fell)

Compare **I wish** and **I hope**:
> **I wish** you **a pleasant stay** here.  
> **I hope** you **have** a pleasant stay here.

(**wish希望一些基本不可能发生的事情，主要用来表达遗憾；hope希望能发生的事情发生**)
---
We also use **wish** to say that we regret something,that something is not as we would like it.When we use **wish** in this way, we use the past (**knew/lived** etc, but the meaning is present:
> I **wish** I **knew** what to do about the problem. (I don't know and I regret this)

To say that we regret something in the past, we use **wish+had** ...
> I **wish I'd known** about the party. I would have gone if I'd known.
---
**I wish I could**(**do** something) = I regret that I cannot do it:
> I'm sorry I have to go. I **wish** I **could stay** longer.

**I wish I could have**(**done** something) = I regret that I could not do it:
> I hear that party was great. I **wish I could have gone**.
---
you can say '**I wish** (somebody) **would** (do something)'.For example:
> It's been raining all day. Tanya doesn't like it. She says: **I wish** it **would stop** raining.

Tanya would like the rain to stop, but this will probably not happen.

We use **I wish ... would** when we would like something to happen or change. Usually, the speaker doesn't expect to happen.

We often use **I wish ... would** to complain about a situation:
> The phone has been ringing for five minutes. **I wish** somebody **would answer** it.
> **I wish** you **wouldn't keep** i interrupting me.

We use **I wish ... would ...** to say that we want something to happen. But we do not use **I wish ... would ...** to say how we would like things to be. Compare:
> I **wish** Sarah **would** come. (=I want her to come)  
> I **wish** Sarah **was(or were)** here now.(not I wish Sarah would be)

> I **wish** somebody **would buy** me a car.  
> I **wish I had** a car.(not I wish I would have).
