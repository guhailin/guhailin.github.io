# Unit6 过去进行时Past continuous(I was doing)

I **was doing** something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or situation had already started before this time, but had not finished.

>This time last year I **was doing** in Brazil.  
>What **were** you **doing** at 10 o'clock last night?  
>I waved to Helen, but she **wasn't looking**.  

We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the middle of something else:

> Matt **phoned** while we **were having** dinner.  
> It **was raining** when I **got** up.  
> I **saw** you in the park yesterday. You **were sitting** on the grass and **reading** a book.  
> I **hurt** my back while I **was working** in the garden.

But we use the past simple to say that one thing happened after another.

> I **was walking** along the road when I **saw** Dan. So I **stopped**, and we **had** a chat.

Compare:
> When Karen arrived, we **were having** dinner. (=we had alread started before she arrived)  
> When Karen arrived, we **had** dinner.(=Karen arrived, and then we had dinner)

Some verbs(for example,**know** and **want**) are not normally used in the continuous(see Unit 4A):

> We were good friends, We **knew** each other well.
> I was enjoying the party, but Chris **wanted** to go home.
